//command executed during a game is passed to this function.

/*
In this function, a check is first performed to see if a command is passed as the second argument. If so, the string is manipulated
to obtain the ship placement coordinates and the type of ship to be placed is based on the number of ships that have already been
placed (This is only possible thanks to the orderly insertion of ships into the grid during the game).
Otherwise, the ship's orientation is randomly generated and, based on that, the stern and bow positions are randomly generated 
and the ship is placed between those positions. Then the function proceeds to print these positions to a file.
